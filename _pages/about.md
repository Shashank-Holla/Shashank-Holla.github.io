Hi! My name is Shashank Holla. I'm a Computer Science Graduate from Indiana University, Bloomington. My interests lies in Computer Vision and Natural language domain.

Prior to graduate school, I interned at Machani Robotics where we built software for humanoid robots. Before that, I worked at Infosys where I worked on building performance efficient systems.
